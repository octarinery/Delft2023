Leaving tomorrow.

Had just one prep task left: check that I can take off the pedals since they do not fit in the bike case. After trying three spanners, googling which way pedals unscrew twice and finally dislodging them by leveraging the spanner on an exercise weight and standing on it, I went to Decathlon for the third time for this trip to get foldable pedals. 

Apps have been downloaded, Strava beacon set up, check ins completed, all Euro coins around the house collected.

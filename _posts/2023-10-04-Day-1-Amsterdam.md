Since none of these adventures I go on ever go smoothly, I tend to compensate with too much buffer time to deal with all the things that do go wrong. 

Luggage drop opens at 13:50, so I should be at the airport at 12:50 to give myself plently bicycle disassembly time. Google says it takes 52 minutes to cycle to the airport, so make that two hours to allow for getting lost and puncture repair, so I should leave at 10:50, add another hour for doing-a-thing-for-the-first-time allowance. 

So, naturally, I am now here 2 full hours before bag drop even opens and I cannot go stick my shoes into a hand dryer until I get rid of my bike.

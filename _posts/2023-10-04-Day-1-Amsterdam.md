Since none of these adventures I go on ever go smoothly, I tend to compensate with too much buffer time to deal with all the things that do go wrong. 

Luggage drop opens at 13:50, so I should be at the airport at 12:50 to give myself plently bicycle disassembly time. Google says it takes 52 minutes to cycle to the airport, so make that two hours to allow for getting lost and puncture repair, so I should leave at 10:50, add another hour for doing-a-thing-for-the-first-time allowance. 

So, naturally, I am now here 2 full hours before bag drop even opens and I cannot go stick my shoes into a hand dryer until I get rid of my bike. 

Forgot to attach the bike's water bottle and I think I left my toothbrush too. Speaking of water, I would like to suggest a new feature to google maps: "Avoid cobblestones when I cannot see anything due to rain drops pooling on my eyelashes". 

# Flying with a bicycle
Over the last few weeks telling people I'm going to the Netherlands with a bicycle has been met with a varying level of concern, but it's actually not difficult. 

First, you have to buy a bike ticket. It's a luggage option under 'sports equipment'. 

Next, you have to put your bike in a box. Every time I have flown with a bike previously, I would visit a bicycle shop and ask for a box. Nobody ever attempted to charge me for it - they're just the boxes the bikes are shipped to the shop and are thrown out. Let the air out of the tires for aircraft pressure reasons and tape the box shut. 

Transportation: when I lived in Copenhagen it was a matter of pushing the box onto the train at Trekroner, moderately inconveniencing everyone getting on and off the train for 20 minutes and then getting it back down at Copenhagen airport, almost directly onto a baggage cart, so if oyu live somewhere with reasonable public transport, congratulations.

Checking in the bike: follow the normal baggage drop procedure for the airline. For example, flying with easyJet, I had to go to a self service kiosk, put the bike on a scale and the luggage tag sticker came out. Once the box is tagged however, it needs to go to Oversize baggage drop point instead of where normal suitcases go. There's one for all the airlines that will check your boarding pass again and accept your oddly shaped object.

Arrival: the bike is going to the oversize babbage drop point instead of the normal belt, which is a always a sad corner somewhere in the baggage collection area. Schiphol Airport has two of these collection points, which they do not tell you about and I may or may not have lost a whole hour to today. Take the bike out of the box - airports don't seem to mind if you just abandon the bike box at the belt, there's usually a collection of them there. Pump up the tires and off you go - push the bike through "nothing to declare" like it's a normal thing to do.

#Flying with a bike on this particular ill advised bike trip
TODO

18:30 PM, Arrived in Schiphol
I am happy to announce that my bike got through the flight with one smashed reflector. Also one of the gears shifts funny, but that is more likely an assembly problem. I have completed the flight without any of the things I anticipated going wrong: no issues checking in oversize luggage, no issues with a digital only boarding pass. 

I did lose my passport, but that is a tomorrow problem.

Since none of these adventures I go on ever go smoothly, I tend to compensate with too much buffer time to deal with all the things that do go wrong. 

Luggage drop opens at 13:50, so I should be at the airport at 12:50 to give myself plently bicycle disassembly time. Google says it takes 52 minutes to cycle to the airport, so make that two hours to allow for getting lost and puncture repair, so I should leave at 10:50, add another hour for doing-a-thing-for-the-first-time allowance. 

So, naturally, I am now here 2 full hours before bag drop even opens and I cannot go stick my shoes into a hand dryer until I get rid of my bike. 

Forgot to attach the bike's water bottle and I think I left my toothbrush too. Speaking of water, I would like to suggest a new feature to google maps: "Avoid cobblestones when I cannot see anything due to rain drops pooling on my eyelashes. 

18:30 PM, Arrived in Schiphol
I am happy to announce that my bike got through the flight with one smashed reflector. Also one of the gears shifts funny, but that is more likely an assembly problem. I have completed the flight without any of the things I anticipated going wrong: no issues checking in oversize luggage, no issues with a digital only boarding pass. 

I did lose my passport, but that is a tomorrow problem.
